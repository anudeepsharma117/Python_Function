## 💻 Practical Questions

1. Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.  
2. Create a Python function that accepts a string and returns the reverse of that string.  
3. Implement a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of each number.  
4. Write a Python function that checks if a given number is prime or not from 1 to 200.  
5. Create an iterator class in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.  
6. Write a generator function in Python that yields the powers of 2 up to a given exponent.  
7. Implement a generator function that reads a file line by line and yields each line as a string.  
8. Use a lambda function in Python to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.  
9. Write a Python program that uses `map()` to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
10. Create a Python program that uses `filter()` to remove all the vowels from a given string.  
11. Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop. Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of the order number and the product of the price per item and the quantity. The product should be increased by €10 if the value of the order is smaller than €100. Write the program using **lambda and map**.
